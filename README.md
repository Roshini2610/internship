This script performs the following tasks:

Text Extraction:

Utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the uploaded image and extract text content.
Visual Element Segmentation:

Implements basic image segmentation techniques to potentially isolate individual visual elements within the main image. Currently, it's a placeholder and needs to be replaced with actual segmentation code.
Bonus (Optional):

Provides an opportunity to save segmented images and generate HTML output to sort the extracted content into appropriate tags like paragraphs (<p>) and embed static images of visual elements using <img> tags.
You would need to replace "path/to/your/image.jpg" with the path to your image file. This script serves as a foundation, and you can further enhance it based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the chosen Vision API. Additionally, don't forget to set up the Google Cloud Vision API and install the necessary Python packages (google-cloud-vision, Pillow).
